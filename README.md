- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Implemented for monitoring the applicationâ€™s health and performance, providing insights into the application's runtime operations and environment.
- **Docker Deployment**: The application is containerized using Docker, streamlining the deployment process and ensuring consistency across different environments by encapsulating the application and its dependencies into a Docker container.

This platform is designed with scalability and security in mind, leveraging the strengths of the Spring framework and modern development practices to provide a user-friendly and reliable online bookstore.



2. What is it?
Spring framework that simplifies HTTP request and responses.
MVC - model-view-controller

Controller layer -> URL 
Model Layer -> Data representation 
View Layer -> Web page

Dispatcher Servlet -> Front controller, pattern
Handler Mapping


3. Models Needed
Books
@Entity 
@Id -> primary key
@GeneratedValue -> increment automatically 

4. CRUD
create, update, get, delete

5. DTO 
data transfer object -> models Book to DTO, we don't want the data to be floating around the app

6. Service 

specific methods with multiple repository calls


Validation should be on the DTO

7. JPQL

Named vs index
contains vs like
